    Desires:
    * Multiplayer fun... so...
      > enemy mobs are visible (and appear)
      > 'movement tiles' are small, or non tile based
      > has mini-map/ radar
    * iPad fun... so...
      > tapping/ mouse click native
      > Has auto travel

  - Setup PhatomJS unit tests to cover the battleScreen

  - Add user logons with devise


  # Implement below persistent data:

    - user.party_settings.heroes.first
        #=> { id: 1, name: "cecil", row: "", image: "/images/cecil_1" , hero_loadout: "object" }

    - game_data

      - heroes
        - equipment_loadout
        - magic_loadout
        - base_stats
        - afflictions (stat modifiers)
        -

      - party_data

        - combat_setup
          - hero_id
          - position row_index + front/back

        - location
          - dungeon_name: "overworld", map_id: 0, x: 0, y: 0

    - map
      >> id:0, image: "/images/maps/overworld.png", tile_data_id: 0, zoology: {zoologic_data}
      - tile_data (run length encoded specifications of how players can interact with maps)
        -
      - zoologic_data (what mobs are in this dungeon map... what about the world map...)

      Here's some discussion of map tiles... well... images...

CURRENT TASK:

  - Further removing globals so that everything is in the game object

>> Make it so I can start the 'first battle' by querying the battle configuration from the server

>>> it's hard to think about 'securing' the game from a server client standpoint...
    the original was obviously a client only game...

>>>> The user needs to 'login', and the server needs to see their location as
     "first_spawn" and then initiate them into the first battle...
     I can't believe it's all this architecting just to refactor a .js file....

>>>>> I need to start devise logins now.......... =(   =(

>>>>>> After the javascript/ html is loaded, the client needs to ask the server
       "ok, what now?"
       and the server must reply
       "Start this unique battle: { battleConfigs }"

       AND when the client attacks a mob... it actually needs to tell the server
       it's attacking it...

       Shit.... I don't have any sweet kill animations!!! That's where I left off!!!


::Kill Mob Animation::
  >> WOAH!! the animation is way more fluid than this, I just can't step through
     the frames the way I was trying at first!
     The erase steaks appear through the mob, and then radiate outwards from the
     equator of the mob!  It's awesome in slow mo, but you can't step frames and see it.

  1) Fade blue/ purple (first tick)
  2) Stay faded/ do nothing (second tick)
  3) Erase lines through mobs 1-2 pixels wide
  4)
    Fade darker
    Widen erase marks
    Add some erase marks
  5)
    Fade darker
    Widen erase marks
    Add some erase marks
  6) widen erase marks, mob around 50% erased now

  7) Widen/ add erase marks, mob mostly gone?

  8) Erase mob completely


- Swinging animation
- fire whirling animation on mob (from fire sword I guess)
- dmg points animation
- mob death animation


SWING ANIMATION:
  Fight is clicked  (ActionMenu.chooseAction)
  Mob is chosen (ActionMenu.chooseAction)
  ->
    * actor's timer bar is set to zero and set to 'frozen' state
    * A 'fight' animation is set on the hero's animations list
      - I need to work on animationDefinitions for HeroAttack...
        - What should the DSL look like for my basic fight animation?
        - I need to initiate the attack, and request a 'damage_dealt' value
          from the server, so server can reply "9999"




- Mobs are having their clearREct done even after death...


:: REWORK SYSTEM FLOW... ::

- HoverEffect_simpleBird should be an animation applied directly to units with 'flying'



COMPLETE:
  - Fixed browser compatibility issue by hacking the font
  - BugFix:  removed the now pointless edge conditionals webkitRequestAnimationFrame
	- BugFix:  Behavor with font differed one Windows 7, Firefox 37.0.1, solved
	by explicitly declaring div and li heights without ill effect.


** 0.0.1 **

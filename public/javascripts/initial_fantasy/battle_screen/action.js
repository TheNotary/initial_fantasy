// Actions are created when a unit chooses to 'fight' or when a mob casts a
// spell on a target.
// They have associated animations.
// What do actions belong to?
// Units I guess...
// so that means unit.animations is removed in favor of unit.getAnimations()
// which looks up unit.actions...
// hmmm... is that correct?

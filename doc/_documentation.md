So the README is the main docs (I know, it's empty right?) but this folder contains important stuff.  
Because this is a graphics application, there is a pipeline pattern at work which is kind of annoying and messy to work with.  
So basically, every screen has a folder dedicated to it within the `doc/` directory.  
And these folders will contain flowcharts that make the program flow comprehensible.
